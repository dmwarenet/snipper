=======

This was a small side-project done with web.py and Postgres a couple of years back. It has the following functionality

* Shorten any given URL
* Redirect to the URL
* Stats for the shortened URL

Usage
-----

It should be easy to setup the database with the SQL files provided, or you can use the script

    ./loaddb.sh

You should be easily able to setup uWSGI for web.py and get the same running
